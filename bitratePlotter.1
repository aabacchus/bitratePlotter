bitratePlotter - create a graph of bitrate over duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]bitratePlotter\f[R] file1 file2 \&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bitratePlotter\f[R] uses \f[I]matplotlib\f[R] and
\f[I]ffmpeg_bitrate_stats\f[R] (which itself uses FFmpeg) to create
graphs plotting the bitrate of a video or audio file (or files) against
the duration of the clip.
Such graphs can be interesting when considering various types of
compression, in particular the CRF factor in codecs x264, x265, and
libvpx.
Running \f[B]bitratePlotter\f[R] wihtout any input files gives a prompt
for an input file.
